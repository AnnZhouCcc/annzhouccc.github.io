  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Computer Science from Princeton University, advised by <a href="https://netsyn.princeton.edu/people/maria-apostolaki" target="_blank">Maria Apostolaki</a>. 
    I am broadly interested in networks and systems, including their intersections with machine learning.

    Before Princeton, I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">P. Brighten Godfrey</a> from UIUC. 
    I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Kunal-Agrawal.html" target="_blank">Kunal Agrawal</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/home_page/" target="_blank">Angelina Lee</a>.
